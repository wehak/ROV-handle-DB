# ROV-handle-DB
A database for object detection and pose estimation of objects under water. Footage is from a Blueye X3 circling targets at 8 meters depth in the sea.

Images are annotated using [RBOT](https://github.com/henningtjaden/RBOT) for pose tracking and fiducial markers for pose detection. Binary siluette masks and poses are recorded whenever RBOT and the fiducials correspond. Using two separate methods to verify results create reliable data with simple measures.

The dataset contain five models that are made available along with all the footage. Three models are made to resemble ROV handles, one is shackle and the last is a duck figure.
